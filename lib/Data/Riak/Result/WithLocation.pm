=head1 NAME

Data::Riak::Result::WithLocation - Results with a Location

=head1 VERSION

version 1.8

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 location

The location URI as provided by Riak.

=head2 bucket

The L<Data::Riak::Bucket> this result was retrieved from.

=head2 bucket_name

The name of the bucket this result was retrieved from.

=head2 key

The key this object is stored under within its bucket.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 sync

Re-fetches the object from its bucket and returns a new instance representing
the latest version of the object in storage.

=head2 save (%opts)

  $obj->save(
       new_value => $new_value,
       new_links => $new_links,
  );

Saves the object back into its bucket, possibly with a different set of links or
a different value.

If the C<new_value> option isn't given, the current C<-E<gt>value> won't be
altered.

If the C<new_links> option isn't given, the current C<-E<gt>links> won't be
altered.

The updated object is returned.

=head2 save_unless_modified

  $obj->save_unless_modified(
       new_value => $new_value,
       new_links => $new_links,
  );

Line L</save>, but will throw an exception when attempting to overwrite changes
that have been made to this object within Riak since the current C<$obj> has
been retrieved.

=head2 linkwalk

See L<Data::Riak/LINKWALKING>.
